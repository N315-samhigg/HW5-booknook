Ari: about, account.html, adding items to cart, app.js/model.js(account/signin/out)

WHAT NEEDS DONE

Styling for buttons on books.html, messed up because of titles (invisible). can fix this by changing visibility:hidden to display:none. make sure to change in the scss for cart as well

Responsiveness
Footers, books.html, nav, about.html, blog.html, readMore.html, and cart.html
account.html is done + responsive

styling for cart.html

readMe needs content, content will be filled into three different divs and made visible/invisible depending which button user hits
