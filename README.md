## Roles:

Sam: Home, nav, footer, blog, books, app.js(page switching), cart styling, responsiveness

Ari: about, account, adding items to cart, app.js/model.js(account/signin/out), responsiveness

## Function:

This site is meant to serve as a template for a store that wants a site with sections for company info, blog space, and e-commerce options. So far, this site is in a pretty primitive state, but it serves its purpose well.

## WHAT NEEDS DONE:

### Responsiveness -

readMore.html, and cart.html

- to make cart.html more responsive, edit model.js:71

readMore needs content, content will be filled into three different divs and made visible/invisible depending which button user hits
